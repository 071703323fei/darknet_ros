# YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection for ROS

## Overview

This is a ROS package developed for object detection in camera images. You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. In the following ROS package you are able to use YOLO on GPU and CPU. The pre-trained model of the convolutional neural network is able to detect aeroplane, bicycle, bird, boat, bottle, bus, car, cat, chair, cow, dining table, dog, horse, motorbike, person, potted plant, sheep, sofa, train and tv monitor. For more information about YOLO, Darknet, available training data and training YOLO see the following link: [YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection](http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).

The YOLO packages have been tested under ROS Indigo and Ubuntu 14.04. This is research code, expect that it changes often and any fitness for a particular purpose is disclaimed.
